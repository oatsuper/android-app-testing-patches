= Introduction =

These purpose of these Android source patches is make use-case testing on Android devices feasible.

The patches dramatically speed up the interface that HierarchyViewer uses to get a logical dump of a window's GUI structure.  The patches introduce a mechanism so apps with OpenGL-based GUIs can expose their GUI structure for testing.  Finally, the patches expose the GUIs of some OpenGL Android apps: the 3D launcher, gallery, and the camera.

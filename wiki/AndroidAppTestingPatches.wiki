= Introduction =

These purpose of these Android source patches is make use-case testing on Android devices feasible.

The patches dramatically speed up the interface that [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/hierarchy-viewer.html HierarchyViewer] uses to get a logical dump of a window's GUI structure.  The patches introduce a mechanism so apps with OpenGL-based GUIs can expose their GUI structure for testing.  Finally, the patches expose the GUIs of some OpenGL Android apps: the 3D launcher, gallery, and the camera.

== Speed ups ==
HierarchyViewer communicates with ViewServer by sending a command over a socket.  The DUMP command retrieves the GUI Hierarchy, but it is very slow (see [http://groups.google.com/group/android-contrib/browse_thread/thread/de5b348a07bf13f9 this]).  These patches introduce a new command, DUMPQ, that is 20x - 40x faster.
